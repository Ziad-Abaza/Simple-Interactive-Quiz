Welcome to the **Simple Interactive Quiz** project! This is a basic quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It started as a simple idea I had to practice my front-end development skills, and it evolved into a more advanced version as I learned new concepts.

## About the Project

This project was born out of my desire to practice and improve my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It began as a simple quiz interface and gradually evolved into a more interactive and feature-rich application as I learned new techniques and best practices.

The project has two versions:
1. **Basic Version 'main'**: The initial version I created when I was just starting out. It includes a simple quiz interface with basic functionality.
2. **Advanced Version 'advanced-features'**: A more polished version with additional features like a timer, cheat prevention, and improved UI.
